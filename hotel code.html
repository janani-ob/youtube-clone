            <u>Burger:</u><br>
                 This burger is deliciously healthy with veggies and chicken. It is rich in protein and anti-oxidants via spices, herbs, and veggies. Chicken and burger make a perfect combination of a complete meal with moderate carbohydrate and high protein and low fat. 
                 It typically consists of boneless, skinless chicken breast served between slices of bread, on a bun, or on a roll.

            <u>Grilled:</u><br>
                 Chicken is high in protein, low in sodium and is a good source for blood-building vitamin B6, bone-strengthening phosphorus and cell-protecting selenium. Addition of the richest herbal superfood cilantro, not just adds flavour to the grilled chicken tenders but also contributes to providing healthy fats, making the dish overall very heart friendly.
                 Kentucky grilled chicken is marinated and seasoned with a savory blend of six secret herbs and spices and slow-grilled to juicy perfection.
